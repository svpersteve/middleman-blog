Learning is simple. You’re either paying attention, or you aren’t. At any moment you’re either absorbing words and turning them into images your brain can understand, or you’re thinking about something else.

Most of us don’t notice when our minds wander. If we do realise it's happened, we kick ourselves and start thinking about how we got distracted and how we’re not learning anything and how it’s all going wrong, and how we’ll never make it to the end of this course and we’ll never get a job… and so on.

We might then tune back in and be completely lost for where we're up to in the conversation/lecture/video. If it’s a video, we can rewind. But there’s only so many times we can replay the same video before we lose patience with ourselves.

But what if we don’t realise we’re wandering off? What if, at the end of the lecture we look back and realise nothing’s gone in but we’re not sure why? We might decide we’re not as bright as others, or that we have poor memory or listening skills. Our teachers might also reinforce those ideas for you.

You’re either paying attention, or you’re thinking about something else and that is something **you can control**.

Your mind can only focus well on one thing at a time, with the exception of habits. We can drive a car and chat to a friend, but we can’t learn to drive and chat. We can’t text one friend while we chat to another.

So how do we stop getting distracted? Will power and self-awareness. How do we strengthen will-power and self-awareness? With meditation.

The benefits of meditation are endless, and Headspace does a great job discussing them. But from my experience, since I began meditating my brain has been a sponge and I can focus endlessly without getting tired. Every time I realise I’ve been distracted, I bring my mind back to the task at hand.
