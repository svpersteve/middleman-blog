I'm now three months old at FutureLearn! 🎉 It's tradition here to share feedback with new starters at the end of their three month probationary period. So today I had the pleasure of reading four pages of what my peers had to say about me. `Spoiler: It's joyous!` 😄🦄

Here are my ❤️ faves:

>Steve's been great to work with and there's burgeoning potential there; I can see him going a long, long way with the skills he's got.

>It's incredibly refreshing to have someone so exuberant, excitable, and keen in the company. Like, wow.

>Steve shouldn't hesitate to step up and offer direction for the team. He seems to be a very good leader that people warm to and trust. It’s not that he doesn’t do this already, it’s just I think he should feel comfortable in doing more of it.

>He has quickly turned into a leading light for the team, helping us improve our processes, focus on our sprint goals and, of course, experiment with new tools (cough trello).

>Steve’s one of those people whose productivity is infectious and I feel our team has been more productive and engaged since he joined.

>I was surprised to learn that this is his first development role as his professionalism, proactivity, speed of delivery and eagerness to learn are all qualities I’d normally expect of a more senior developer.

>He’s a pleasure to work with and has made our team feel more driven, more fun, and more organised.

>Encouraging and supporting the team move to trello so soon after joining shows confidence in his own skills and knowledge, and a knack for problem solving...

>...plus that was a very good learning hour; he's a very good teacher and will be a great asset to the team...

>...and it was impressive to write [a blog post](https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/learning-to-love-trello/) about it too!

>Steve has not only been great at making suggestions about improvements we can make to the product and how we work as a team, but crucially he’s also been great at making sure that those things actually happen!

>Steve is always keen to help others inside and outside the team and to share what he’s learnt with others. His Trello learning hour was a great success, but he’s also been very good at updating the wiki and other documentation when he’s found gaps.
