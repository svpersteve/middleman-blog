I’ve just had a phone interview for a developer role from heaven, and in my eagerness to present myself well, I sent over a redesigned version of my CV that I had adapted for developer roles. It was shorter, and removed parts relating more to education roles.

During the interview, I was asked why I’d cut out the first paragraph, because they really liked it. Her question caught me by surprise. I had thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Although I hadn’t really, as she still had a copy.

So here, in all its undeleted glory is my summary, back by popular demand.

- <i class="fa fa-star blue o-post__icon"></i> Positivity — I am highly positive, patient and nurturing of others, and I adopt a student-focused, rights and responsibilities based approach to learning that is built on encouraging choice and autonomy for students, highly rewarding environments that stimulate neurotransmitters for learning and encourage behaviours that offer the student the best opportunity to shine in their own unique way.

- <i class="fa fa-star blue o-post__icon"></i> Behaviour — I believe all people, adults and children, are innately good, and that any disruptive behaviours have at their core a reason, and the key to resolving disruptive behaviours is to identify and work on that reason, rather than react to the behaviour itself. A proactive approach is always more effective than a reactive one.

- <i class="fa fa-star blue o-post__icon"></i> Achievement — I believe good habits are the key to success, and if we focus our will power on adopting good habits that have both cues and rewards, then over time habits will form and activities will be undertaken with minimal exertion of will power. I use daily goals to help me form good habits as a motivational tool that guides me in the direction I want to head in. It’s important to choose goals for yourself so you feel in control of your life, and the sense of achievement when you accomplish those goals motivates you. I use this approach with myself and for teaching others.
