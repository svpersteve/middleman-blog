"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" — Aristotle.

I had my first ever code [meetup][meetup] today in Shoreditch. Like, in public with actual real-life people, and it was the next level in my code education.

The goal was to write a kata, which was done several times by [Peter][peter], in about three hours. But what actually happened was nine hours of code wars.

Just being in the presence of people who share the same goal as you — [tackling problems head on like warriors][warriors] — was empowering. But it also made me realise how vital it is to meet with like-minded people.

Collaboration changes you. It’s energising. There’s something radically different about working on problems in a team, even if you’re just sitting at the same table as them. I helped them, they helped me. But often, we just worked alone but I felt stronger, like a warrior in an army.
