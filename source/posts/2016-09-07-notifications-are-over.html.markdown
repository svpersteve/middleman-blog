I've purged literally every single notification but my calendar. No more interuptions from Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, SMS or anything except calls.

Why? After reading [Deep Work](http://amzn.to/2ctoelK) it's hit me how much time I waste being disturbed. How much time I spend constantly being alert to popups on my phone and computer and how easy it is to draw me into endless scrolling of feeds filled with often useless information.

This stops me getting deeply involved in what I really want to do, which trust me is not find out how many people like a Facebook post, what shocking thing I'll read about if I 'click here' or who's following me on Instagram.

Those fleeting bits of information add no value to my life beyond a forgettable reward for doing nothing special.

From now on, I check my services when I'm ready, not when they show up and demand my attention. But as for Facebook and Twitter, I'm doing a 30 day rest from either of those to find out exactly how much I will miss them.

This should free up a huge amount of time I've otherwise been wasting, so I'm going to have to find some quality alternatives to spend my time on. Some options to divide this new time:

* Audible
* Treehouse
* Meditation
* Walks
* Exercise
* Socialising
* Writing
* Travelling
