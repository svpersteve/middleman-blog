There's a scene from Buffy the Vampire Slayer that I'm reminded of a lot lately whenever I catch up with my new skills. I suddenly realise there's something I've wanted to do for ages but haven't been able to, so it lay forgotten.

There was a character in season one called Amy, and she was a witch. At some point she turned herself into a rat to escape being burned at the stake. Willow couldn't figure out how to turn her back into a human again, so she remained a rat in a cage for about three more seasons of the show.

Then, three show years later Willow stopped suddenly, clearly a thought popped into her head, as she realised she might know how to turn Amy back into a human again. She cast a spell and a scroll appeared. She read from it and hey presto, Amy was no longer a rat.

Coding is very much like magic, and every now and then a thought pops into my head and I suddenly realise I now have the skills I didn't have previously to do something cool.
